# AIDIN 2F Gripper — Host SDKs & ROS2 Driver

Host-side software for the **AIDIN 2-finger BLDC gripper** (DH-Robotics
compatible Modbus RTU, 115200 8N1, slave ID 1). Everything here talks to the
gripper over a USB↔RS485 adapter — no vendor DLLs, no external Modbus
library, no network access at build time.

AIDIN 2지 BLDC 그리퍼용 호스트 소프트웨어 모음입니다. USB-RS485 어댑터만
있으면 동작하며, 외부 Modbus 라이브러리 의존성이 없습니다.

## Gripper operating procedure / 그리퍼 실행 절차

`cpp/`, `python/`, `ros2/` all drive the same firmware state machine in the
same order, regardless of which interface you pick.

세 인터페이스(`cpp/`, `python/`, `ros2/`) 모두 동일한 순서로 동일한 펌웨어
상태 머신을 구동합니다. 사용하는 인터페이스와 무관하게 아래 순서를
따르세요.

| # | Step / 단계 | Python | ROS2 | Protocol |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Safety / 주의

The gripper applies real torque to mechanical fingers. Keep hands clear
during homing (fingers seek a hard stop), and clear the workspace before
launching with `auto_home:=true`.

그리퍼는 실제 토크로 핑거를 구동합니다. 호밍 중에는 손을 가까이 두지 말고,
`auto_home:=true` 로 실행하기 전에 작업 공간을 비워 주세요.

## Reference for AI agents / AI 참고 자료

This section is a single, self-contained technical reference for an AI
assistant integrating this gripper into a *different* codebase (a new
language, a different framework) that doesn't want to explore this whole
repo. It restates the protocol precisely enough to write a correct client
from scratch, then points at the three reference implementations that
already exist here.

### What this device is

- AIDIN 2-finger BLDC gripper, DH-Robotics-compatible **Modbus RTU** slave.
- Transport: RS485 over a USB adapter. Default link: **115200 baud, 8 data
  bits, no parity, 1 stop bit (8N1)**, slave address **1** (changeable,
  1..247).
- Function codes the device accepts: **0x03** (Read Holding Registers),
  **0x06** (Write Single Register), **0x10** (Write Multiple Registers).
  The SDKs in this repo use 0x03/0x06. Every register below is a 16-bit
  holding register at its protocol-level (PDU) address.
- Detailed per-register documentation — bit maps, value scaling, usage
  sequences, Modbus frame examples — is in the **AIDIN Gripper Modbus RTU
  Protocol Manual** (`aidin_modbus_rtu_manual.pdf` / `.html`, Manual Rev 2.0
  · Spec v1.10.3, in the firmware repo `aidin-bldc-firmware/docs/`). The
  canonical register contract is `docs/protocol/protocol.md` in the same
  repo. Neither is included here — only the **core registers** mirrored in
  [`cpp/include/aidin/registers.hpp`](cpp/include/aidin/registers.hpp) /
  [`python/aidin_gripper/registers.py`](python/aidin_gripper/registers.py)
  are exercised by this repo's SDKs; the extended blocks below (config,
  force control, sensors) are summarized from the manual.

#### Motion control / 동작 제어 (Write, `0x0100~`)

| Addr | R/W | Field | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x0100` | W | `ACTION` | activation / homing / go-to / emergency-release bitfield — see below |
| `0x0101` | W | `SPEED` (`rSP`) | 0..255 (255 = 100% of `MAX_VELOCITY`; 0 still keeps an internal minimum) |
| `0x0102` | W | `FORCE` (`rFR`) | 0..255 current/force limit (0 = 25% hardware floor, 255 = 100%) |
| `0x0103` | W | `POSITION` (`rPR`) | 0..255 — **0 = fully open, 255 = fully closed** |

#### Status & telemetry / 상태·텔레메트리 (Read, `0x0200~`)

| Addr | R/W | Field | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x0200` | R | `STATUS` | bitfield — see below |
| `0x0201` | R | `FAULT` (`gFLT`) | current fault code, 0 = OK — see fault code table below |
| `0x0202` | R | `POS_ECHO` (`gPR`) | echo of the last `rPR` written |
| `0x0203` | R | `POS_ACTUAL` (`gPO`) | actual position 0..255 (reads 0 until homed) |
| `0x0204` | R | `CUR_ACTUAL` (`gCU`) | actual motor current 0..255 (normalized to `NOMINAL_CURRENT`) |
| `0x0205` | R | `SPD_ACTUAL` (`gSP`) | actual speed 0..255 (normalized to `MAX_VELOCITY`) |
| `0x0206` | R | `VOLTAGE` (`gV`) | supply voltage — register × 0.1 = volts |
| `0x0207` | R | `FAULT_LATCH` (`gFLTO`) | latched fault history — persists until cleared with `DEV_CMD 0x07 FAULT_CLEAR` |

`STATUS`..`FAULT_LATCH` (`0x0200`..`0x0207`, 8 registers) are meant to be
read **in one block transaction**, not one register at a time — that's
what every SDK's `read_state()` / `readState()` does.


### `ACTION` bits (write, `0x0100`)

| Bit | Name | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `rACT` | level | 1 = request activation. The firmware ignores nearly every other command while this is 0. |
| 1 | `rHOM` | **rising edge** | trigger homing. Must go 0→1; holding it at 1 does nothing again. |
| 3 | `rGTO` | level, edge-sensitive re-trigger | 1 = go to `rPR`. Re-commanding the *same* position while `rGTO` is already 1 is ignored — pulse it 0→1 to force re-execution (firmware ≥ v1.9.1). |
| 4 | `rATR` | **rising edge** | emergency auto-release. Only processed while `rACT=1`. |
| 5 | `rADR` | level | auto-release direction: 0 = open, 1 = close. Set before/with the `rATR` pulse. |

Because `ACTION` is one register, every write replaces *all* of these bits
at once — there is no way to set one bit without knowing (or explicitly
re-asserting) the others. This is also why `emergency_release()` writing
`rATR` (without `rACT`) leaves the device with `rACT=0`: the *next*
`activate()` call is what clears the release latch and restores normal
`move_to()`/`moveTo()` behavior.

### `STATUS` bits (read, `0x0200`)

| Bits | Name | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `gACT` | activated |
| 1 | `gHOM` | homed |
| 3 | `gGTO` | echo of `rGTO` |
| 4-5 | `gSTA` | `00`=Reset, `01`=Activating, `11`=Active |
| 6-7 | `gOBJ` | `00`=Moving, `01`=stopped on object while opening, `10`=stopped on object while closing, `11`=at target |

### Fault codes / 폴트 코드 (`gFLT` / `gFLTO`)

`gFLT` (0x0201) is the live fault, `gFLTO` (0x0207) is the latched
history — check it for faults that came and went, then clear with
`DEV_CMD 0x07 FAULT_CLEAR`. 원인·조치 상세는 매뉴얼 참고.

| Code | Name | Meaning / action |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `OK` | normal operation |
| 1 | `NOT_INITIALIZED` | not activated — send `rACT = 1` |
| 2 | `INVALID_COMMAND` | unsupported command received |
| 3 | `INVALID_PARAMETER` | parameter out of range |
| 4 | `OVER_CURRENT` | over-current — check the load, power-cycle |
| 5 | `OVER_TEMPERATURE` | over-temperature — cool down, restart |
| 6 | `UNDER_VOLTAGE` | supply voltage too low — check the power supply |
| 7 | `MOTOR_STALL` | motor stall — check for a mechanical jam |
| 8 | `SENSOR_ERROR` | encoder signal error — check wiring |
| 9 | `COMM_TIMEOUT` | communication timeout — check cable / baud rate |
| 10 | `INTERNAL_ERROR` | internal error — power-cycle, contact A/S if persistent |
| 11 | `GATE_DRIVER_FAULT` | gate-driver hardware fault (OCP/OTSD/UVLO) — check supply/wiring, then `FAULT_CLEAR` |

#### Device config & developer channel / 장치 설정 (`0x0180~`)

Config writes land in RAM only — persist them with `DEV_CMD 0x02
SAVE_CONFIG`; address/baud changes apply after a power cycle. 상세 절차는
매뉴얼 참고.

| `0x0183`/`0x0184` | R | `CFG_MB_BAUD_LO/HI` | serial baud rate as 32-bit LO/HI (e.g. 115200 → `0xC200`/`0x0001`) |
| `0x0185`/`0x0186` | R/W | `CFG_CAN_ID` / `CFG_CAN_RATE` | FDCAN node ID / rate (1 = 1 Mbps, 2 = 500 kbps) |

| `0x018B` | R | `CFG_STROKE_MRAD` | calibrated stroke [rad × 1000] — set only by `DEV_CMD 0x0A STROKE_CAL` |
| `0x0190~0x0196` | R/W | `PID_*` | position/speed/current loop gains — tuning only, see manual |
| `0x0197~0x019A` | R/W | `FF_*` | position feedforward gains — applied via `DEV_CMD 0x0B/0x0C` |

#### (지속 업데이트) Force control / 힘 제어 (`0x01A0~0x01A9`)

Constant-force grasp, impedance/admittance compliance, hand-guiding. Gains
are int16 fixed-point (register = physical gain × 10). Write parameters
first, switch `FC_MODE` last, then **read `FC_MODE` back** — the firmware
resets it to 0 when entry is rejected (e.g. impedance/admittance before
homing). 모드별 파라미터, 단위계, 안전 폴백 등 상세는 매뉴얼 참고.

| Addr | R/W | Field | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x01A0` | R/W | `FC_MODE` | 0 = off · 1 = simple · 2 = impedance · 3 = admittance — readback = actual mode |
| `0x01A1` | W | `FC_FORCE` | target force (simple) / external force F_ext (admittance) [mA] |
| `0x01A2~0x01A4` | W | `FC_STIFFNESS` / `FC_DAMPING` / `FC_MASS` | Kx / Kb / Mv gains (× 10) |
| `0x01A5` | W | `FC_EQUIL` | equilibrium position 0..255 (0 = open) — live-updatable while active |
| `0x01A6` | W | `FC_SPEED_LIMIT` | speed safety limit [rad/s × 100], 0 = firmware default |
| `0x01A7` | W | `FC_FB_SRC` | feedback source: 0 = sensorless · 1/2 = AFT tip1/tip2 Fz · 3 = tip1+tip2 · 4 = Iq self-sensing |
| `0x01A8` | R | `FC_FORCE_ACT` | measured force feedback — [N × 100] with F/T sensor source, else [mA] |

#### (개발중, 지속 업데이트 예정) External sensors / 외부 센서 (Read, `0x0210~`)

Fingertip sensor values relayed from CAN; select the sensor with
`CFG_SENSOR_TYPE` (0x018A) + `SAVE_CONFIG` + power cycle. Tare with
`DEV_CMD 0x08 SENSOR_ZERO`. 상태 비트필드와 스케일링 상세는 매뉴얼 참고.

| Addr | R/W | Field | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x0210~0x0216` | R | `SENSOR_STATUS`, `FT_FX..FT_TZ` | tip 1 six-axis F/T — force [N × 100], torque [Nm × 1000] |
| `0x0217~0x021D` | R | `SENSOR2_STATUS`, `FT2_FX..FT2_TZ` | tip 2, same layout — poll both tips as one 14-register block read |
| `0x0220~0x0241` | R | `TACT1_*` | tip 1 tactile (AIDIN-FS) cell map — status + cell count + 32 cells [N × 100] |
| `0x0242~0x0263` | R | `TACT2_*` | tip 2, same layout — poll both tips as one 68-register block read from `0x0220` |
| `0x01B0~0x01B9` | W | `TACT_CMD_*` | tactile sensor CAN command buffer — transmitted with `DEV_CMD 0x09` |

### Key `DEV_CMD` codes (`0x0180`)

Write the code to `DEV_CMD` (0x0180), then poll `DEV_STATUS` (0x0181)
until it leaves RUNNING (→ OK or ERROR). 전체 코드 목록(전기각 보정,
PID 저장/복원 등)과 절차는 매뉴얼 참고.

| Code | Name | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `0x02` | `SAVE_CONFIG` | persist the config registers (`0x0182~`) to flash |
| `0x07` | `FAULT_CLEAR` | acknowledge the motor fault + clear latched `gFLTO` |

| `0x0A` | `STROKE_CAL` | re-measure the usable stroke after a fingertip change (~20 s, saved to flash) |

> Flash-writing commands (`SAVE_CONFIG`, `SAVE_PID`, `FF_SAVE`) stall
> Modbus for ~10 ms — use a response timeout ≥ 50 ms.

### Protocol invariants an integration needs to get right

- **Position is inverted from what you might guess**: `0` = open, `255` = closed.
- `rHOM`/`rATR` are edge-triggered, not level-triggered — write them low,
  then high (every SDK here waits ~20 ms between the two writes), or the
  firmware never sees a transition.
- Re-issuing a move to the *same* position while already moving there
  needs an `rGTO` 0→1 pulse, not just rewriting `rGTO=1`.
- `emergency_release()`/`emergencyRelease()` drops `rACT` — call
  `activate()` again afterward, or every subsequent command is ignored.
- If you use **force control** (`FC_*`): write the parameters first and
  switch `FC_MODE` last, then **read `FC_MODE` back** — the firmware
  silently resets it to 0 when entry is rejected (impedance/admittance
  require homing first) and when `rATR` force-terminates force control.
- Treat a full status read (8 registers, `0x0200`-`0x0207`) as one
  transaction; don't split it into 8 separate reads, both for latency and
  because the fields are meant to be read as one consistent snapshot.
- **RS485 multi-drop**: several grippers can share one physical bus if
  each has a distinct `CFG_MB_ADDR`, but only one Modbus transaction may
  be in flight on the wire at a time. All three SDKs in this repo share
  one underlying serial connection per port path and serialize
  transactions with a lock/mutex whenever more than one logical device
  object targets the same port — don't open the port twice from
  independent client objects, and don't fire transactions from multiple
  threads without equivalent serialization if you re-implement this
  elsewhere.

### Multi-drop: sharing one connection across slave IDs (the pattern used here)

Naively giving each logical gripper its own client object breaks as soon
as two of them target the same physical port: opening a COM port twice
fails outright on Windows, and on Linux it can silently interleave two
independent handles' bytes on the wire and corrupt every transaction.
This repo solves it the same way in both compiled SDKs — the pattern to
copy if you're writing a fourth client:

- A **process-wide registry keyed by port path** (`{port_path: shared_transport}`)
  holds one already-open transport per physical port.
- `connect(port, ..., slave_id)` looks the port up in the registry. Not
  found → open it, create the shared transport, register it. Found →
  reuse it, but reject the call if `baudrate`/`parity` don't match what's
  already open (those are properties of the wire, not of one device).
- Each logical `Gripper` object keeps only its own `slave_id` plus a
  reference to the shared transport — never its own OS handle.
- The shared transport owns a **mutex/lock held only around a single
  register read or write**, not around a whole `activate()`/`home()`
  call — so gripper A's 15-second homing doesn't block gripper B's status
  polling.
- The transport is closed automatically once every `Gripper` sharing it
  has disconnected (reference counting — Python does it explicitly with
  an int counter; C++ leans on `std::shared_ptr`/`std::weak_ptr` and gets
  this for free).

Reference implementations:
[`python/aidin_gripper/gripper.py`](python/aidin_gripper/gripper.py)
(`_SharedPort` / `_port_registry`) and
[`cpp/src/gripper.cpp`](cpp/src/gripper.cpp) (`SharedBus` /
`portRegistry()`), demonstrated end-to-end in
[`python/examples/07_multi_gripper_two_slaves.py`](python/examples/07_multi_gripper_two_slaves.py).

**Scope limit**: the registry lives in one process's memory, so this only
shares a port across multiple client objects *within the same process*.
Two independent OS processes (e.g. two separately-launched
`aidin_gripper_driver` ROS2 node instances) each still open the port for
themselves and will conflict if pointed at the same physical port — the
ROS2 driver as shipped is one node = one gripper = one port; running two
grippers on one bus under ROS2 currently means giving each its own
port/adapter, not sharing one, unless you extend the driver to own
multiple slave IDs itself.

### Minimal integration algorithm (language-agnostic)

```
open(port, baud=115200, 8N1)

write(ACTION, rACT)                            # request activation
poll read(STATUS) until gSTA == Active          # or timeout -> error

write(ACTION, rACT)                            # ensure rHOM low
sleep(20ms)
write(ACTION, rACT | rHOM)                     # rising edge
sleep(100ms)                                    # let firmware clear gHOM first
poll read(STATUS..FAULT_LATCH) until gHOM==1 or gFLT!=0   # or timeout -> error

write(SPEED, speed); write(FORCE, force); write(POSITION, pos)
write(ACTION, rACT | rGTO)
if blocking:
    poll read(STATUS..FAULT_LATCH) until gOBJ != Moving or gFLT!=0   # or timeout -> error

# status monitoring: read(STATUS..FAULT_LATCH) on whatever cadence you need
# fault/jam recovery: write(ACTION, rATR [| rADR]) briefly, then re-run the activate step
```

### Same algorithm, three ways (already implemented here)

| Step | Python (`python/aidin_gripper`) | C++ (`aidin::Gripper`, `cpp/`) | ROS2 (`aidin_gripper_driver`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Connect | `g.connect(port, baudrate, parity, slave_id)` | `g.connect(port, baud, parity, slaveId)` | `port`/`baudrate`/`parity`/`slave_id` params |
| Activate | `g.activate()` | `g.activate()` | `/activate` (`Trigger`) |
| Home | `g.home()` | `g.home()` | `/home` (`Trigger`) |
| Move | `g.move_to(pos, speed, force, blocking)` | `g.moveTo(pos, speed, force, blocking)` | `/move_to` (`MoveTo`) |
| Status | `g.read_state()` → `GripperState` | `g.readState()` → `GripperState` | subscribe `/state` (`GripperState` msg, 50 Hz) |
| Emergency release | `g.emergency_release(close_direction)` | `g.emergencyRelease(closeDirection)` | `/emergency_release` (`EmergencyRelease`) |
| Raw register access | `g.read_register()` / `g.write_register()` | `g.readRegister()` / `g.writeRegister()` | `/dev_cmd` (opt-out, factory only) |
| Errors | raises `GripperError` | throws `GripperError` | service `success=false` + `message` |
